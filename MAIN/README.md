# Lead Scoring and Prediction System

A comprehensive machine learning-based system for evaluating and prioritizing sales leads. This system uses various features including demographic data, behavioral patterns, and engagement metrics to provide accurate lead scoring.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Feature importance analysis
- Model evaluation and performance metrics
- Lead scoring pipeline
- Interactive visualization dashboard

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your data in the `data/` directory
2. Run the data preprocessing pipeline:
   ```bash
   python src/data/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/models/train.py
   ```
4. Generate lead scores:
   ```bash
   python src/models/predict.py
   ```

## Model Features

The system considers various features for lead scoring:

- Demographic data (age, location, company size)
- Behavioral patterns (website visits, email opens)
- Engagement metrics (time spent, interaction frequency)
- Historical conversion data
- Custom scoring rules

## Performance Metrics

- ROC-AUC Score
- Precision-Recall Curve
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance Analysis
